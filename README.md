APEX Media Extension (AME) plug-in for Oracle Application Express (APEX)

[APEX Media Extension (AME)](https://www.apexmediaextension.com) makes it easy to process or convert media before or after it is stored in the Oracle Database. AME is perfect as replacement for Oracle Intermedia/Multimedia.

### Do you need to process or convert media, such as:

- resize images
- crop images (for example take a part out of a picture)
- overlay images (for example to add watermark)
- compress images
- rotate and flip images
- change image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, tif, gif, webp, bmp)
- retrieve meta-data
- before or after you store the media in the database, your file system, or the cloud? 

APEX Media Extension (AME) can help! It provides a REST API, PL/SQL API, and an APEX Plug-in which can transform your media on the client or on the server side.
